This release improves support for github OAuth. The previous release
did not request the proper scope for private repositories. If you
already obtained a token, or wish to switch from name and password
auth, then run g8 with your github name and password separated by
a `:` character:

[private]: https://github.com/n8han/conscript/issues/39

    g8 --auth yourname:yourpass

If successful, this command stores an access token in `~/.g8/config`
which is used for all future `g8` invocations. You can revoke tokens
at any time in your [github account settings][tokens].

[tokens]: https://github.com/settings/applications
