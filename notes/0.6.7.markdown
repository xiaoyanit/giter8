This release includes two user-contributed enhancements:

*  Move to latest version of Scalasti / StringTemplate V4 [#144][144]
*  Resolve latest versions through Maven metadata [#136][136]

With the second of these, giter8 templates can refer to the latest
published version of an artifact using metadata you're already
publishing to the central repository.

> In your `default.properties`, define a value as `maven(groupId, artifactId)` to have its latest version looked up from the central repo. Keep in mind that Scala projects are typically published with a Scala version identifier in the artifact id. So for the Unfiltered library, we could refer to the latest version as follows:

    unfiltered_version = maven(net.databinder, unfiltered_2.11)
