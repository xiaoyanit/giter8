### Integration with ls.implicit.ly

Giter8 templates can now use *ls* to resolve the latest published
version of a library. Just specify the library name and authoritative
github account as a property value. For example:

    name = My Template Project
    giter8_version = ls(giter8-plugin, n8han)
    description = Creates a giter8 project template.

This template ([n8han/giter8.g8][gg8]) assigns the latest version of
giter8-plugin to the property `giter8_version`, which you can then
refer from other files like any other template value.

Templates that use this feature will not be compatible with other
versions of giter8, so users are encouraged to upgrade right away. You
can upgrade (or install) giter8 with one [conscript][cs] command:

[cs]: https://github.com/n8han/conscript

    cs n8han/giter8
