* support for remote templates [with binary files and images](https://github.com/n8han/giter8/pull/14)
* support for resolving templates hosted on a branch of a github repository

Example:

    g8 user/repo         // will fetch from the master branch of users's repo
    g8 user/repo -b foo  // will fetch template from the `foo` branch of user's repo
