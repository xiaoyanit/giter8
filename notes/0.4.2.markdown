### Obligatory Upgrade

Because github is [terminating its v2 APIs][gh] on May 1, 2012 and
these are used by all earlier versions of giter8, you must upgrade in
order to continue using the software.

If you installed with Conscript, you can upgrade immediately:

    cs n8han/giter8

### Improvements

* `random` formatter for template properties, appends random characters
  to the given string { [pk11][pk] }
* Refactor to allow easier external use of giter8 templating { [n8han][rf] }
