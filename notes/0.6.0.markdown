This release provides more options for developing and testing giter8
templates.

Firstly, local templates definitions referred to with a `file://` URL
are accessed directly as files rather than git repositories. It is no
longer necessary to stage or commit local changes before testing them
through the `g8` executable.

Secondly, a new `-f / --force` option causes `g8` to overwrite files
in the target directory without prompting.

Together, these changes make it easy to save a template file, run
`g8`, and test changes in the project. If the template project
produces an sbt build, for example, you can stay in its interactive
session while coding and applying changes to the source templates.

To upgrade via conscript, run `cs n8han/giter8`
